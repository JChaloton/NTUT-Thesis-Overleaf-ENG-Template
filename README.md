- The default compiler for Overleaf is pdfLaTeX, **Don't forget** to change the PDF compiler to **XeLaTeX** or else it won't compile.

### Documents

- The `ntut-labels.tex` has all the parameters for the front page, such as department name, title, degree, student name, advisor name, etc.
- The `page/abstract.tex` and `page/abstract-en.tex` contain the content for your abstracts; the Chinese version is optional.
- The `main.tex` compiles and includes other pages, such as the abstract, acknowledgments, table of contents, thesis chapters, and references.
- The `chapter/` folder contains all of your thesis chapters. Feel free to add as many chapters as you need.
- The `static-page/signpage.pdf` is a completed 'Oral Defense Committee Signature Form' with all committee signatures.
